# CountdownEvents
Application for tracking remaining time for dates

### Architecture
At the beginging a Clean Architecture Pattern was followed, but after creating `build-ligic` module to include Gradle Convention Plugin, I decided to refactor all and split it into different modules having `app` as just to use what ever all other modules contain.

```
features: Include, UI and ViewModels
```
